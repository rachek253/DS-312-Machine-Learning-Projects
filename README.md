# DS-312-Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains a variety of projects done in Fall 2024 for my Machine Learning Course. Each project features a different machine learning algorithm that I learned over the course of the semester. Here is a brief overview of what each project consists of:

Project 1: 
- Theoretical Foundations of Linear Regression
- Implementation of a simple Linear Regression model on the California Housing dataset using gradient descent from scratch
- Implementaiton of a simple Linear Regression model on the California Housing dataset using Python's Scikit-Learn library
- Comparative analysis for both models

Project 2:
- Theoretical Foundations of Multiple Linear Regression
- Implementation of a Multiple Linear Regression Model on the California Housing dataset from scratch
- Implementation of a Multiple Linear Regression Model on the California Housing dataset using Scikit-Learn
- Comparative Analysis for both models

Project 3:
- Exploratory Data Analysis on Scikit-Learn Diabetes dataset
- Implementation of Linear Regression on the Diabetes dataset with 5-fold cross-validation
- Implementation of Ridge Regression on the Diabetes dataset with 5-fold cross-validation
- Implementation of Lasso Regression on the Diabetes dataset with 5-fold cross-validation
- Performance comparison of all models using R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values

Project 4:
- Theorectical foundations of a Bayesian Classifier with Gaussian class-conditionals
- Implementation of a Bayesian Classifier on the UCI Congressional Voting Records dataset
- Implementation of Logistic Regression on the UCI Congressional Voting Records dataset
- Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on the UCI Congressional Voting Records dataset
- Performance comparison of all models using F1-scores, accuracy, precision, recall, and the receiver operating characteristic - area under the curve (ROC-AUC)

Project 5: 
- Manual creation of decision boundaries of a decision tree algorithm, as well as manual creation of a decision tree
- Manual calculations of Information Gain (IG) using a supplied dataset
- Manual calculations of Gini Index using the same supplied datset

Project 6:
- Implementation of K-Means Clustering on Scikit-Learn's Digits dataset from scratch
- Implementation of K-Medoids Clustering on Scikit-Learn's Digits dataset from scratch
- Implementation of Hierarchical Clustering using Scikit-Learn on the Digits dataset

Project 7:
- Implementation of numerous Neural Networks on the Keras MNIST dataset
- Implementation of numerous Neural Networks with 10-fold cross-validation on the Boston Housing Price datset from Python's Keras package
